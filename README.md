# Cecilia

Cecilia is a library to generate and inspect programs and libraries in the ECMA CIL form.

To put it simply, you can use Cecilia to:

* Analyze .NET binaries using a simple and powerful object model, without having to load assemblies to use Reflection.
* Modify .NET binaries, add new metadata structures and alter the IL code.

Cecilia is a fork of [Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil) that aims to modernize the codebase and improve performance while being able to afford big (and somethimes breaking) changes.
